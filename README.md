# ⚛️ Physics Assistant: Feynman Lectures Chatbot

A Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) based chatbot that answers physics questions using content from the **Feynman Lectures on Physics**. This assistant leverages vector search for document retrieval and a Large Language Model (LLM) for response generation.

Built with **LangChain**, **Gradio**, and **ChromaDB**.

## 🧠 Project Overview

The Physics Assistant uses a **RAG pipeline** to answer physics queries by retrieving relevant passages from the *Feynman Lectures* and feeding them to an LLM for context-aware responses.

Key features:
- 🔍 Retrieval from Feynman Lectures
- 🧾 Context-aware generation using LLMs (e.g., LLaMA)
- 💬 Interactive chat interface via Gradio
- ⚡ Fast inference with local vector store
